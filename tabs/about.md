We’re making sure it works for everyone.

Before Remote Care Partners, Remote Patient Monitoring and Telehealth weren’t living up to their full potential. Patients had to deal with complicated apps and downloads. Nurses and staff had to learn complex new systems and handle device inventory and shipping. Doctors had to pay upfront fees.

Fortunately, we had a better idea…

We created a platform that eliminates the barriers to Remote Patient Care.
For everyone.
